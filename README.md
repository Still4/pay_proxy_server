PHP version of get http response undirectly

Think of these situations:
1. When a server wants to started an API to 3rd party, but GFW makes the communication very hard.
2. When a group of servers want to started API to 3rd party, but 3rd party has a whitelist, you can't put all of them in whitelist.

Of course first you should have another server can attach to 3rd party easily, and then start API with this code.

Samples will be provided soon.
