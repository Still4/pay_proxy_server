PHP version of get http response undirectly

Think of these situations:
1. A single server wants to call APIs to 3rd party servers, but GFW makes the communication difficult.
2. A group of servers want to call APIs to 3rd party servers, they need to add all there server IPs to whitelist, but your servers are growing everyday, it's impossible to provide a list.

So we got a solution here, we need a server playing the role like a bridge to connect them, of course this server must have access to both sides.

Samples will be provided soon.
